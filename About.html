                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>California's history is rich and diverse. Originally home to numerous Native American tribes, the region was first visited by Europeans in the 16th century, with Spanish exploration beginning in earnest in the late 18th century. Spanish missionaries established a chain of missions along the coast, giving rise to settlements that would eventually become major cities. California became a U.S. territory following the Mexican-American War and was swiftly admitted as a state in 1850. The Gold Rush of 1849 brought a wave of settlers, fundamentally altering the state's economy and demographics. In the 20th century, California developed rapidly, becoming a cultural, economic, and technological hub, symbolized by Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and its vibrant multicultural cities.</p>

                <h2>The Economy</h2>
                <p>California boasts one of the largest economies in the world. Known for its diversity, the state's economy is driven by agriculture, entertainment, technology, and tourism. Silicon Valley, situated in the Bay Area, is globally recognized as a hub of innovation and high-tech industry, housing many of the world's leading tech companies. Los Angeles and Hollywood are key players in the entertainment sector. California is also a leader in agriculture, producing a significant proportion of the country's fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Tourism thrives due to its national parks, coastal cities, and attractions like Disneyland.</p>
                <p>The average income in California reflects the state's varied economy and cost of living. As of the most recent data, the median household income is approximately $80,000, which is significantly higher than the national average. However, this figure varies widely across regions, with higher averages in affluent areas like Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, and lower incomes in rural and less economically developed regions. The state's high cost of living, particularly in housing, has led to disparities in income distribution and affordability challenges for many residents.</p>
