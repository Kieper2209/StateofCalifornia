                    <h3>San Jose History</h3>
                    <p>San Jose, founded in 1777 as El Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe, was the first civilian settlement in Spanish California. It served as an agricultural center during Mexican rule and continued to grow after California became part of the United States. Following World War II, it rapidly expanded from an agricultural town into a bustling urban center, ultimately becoming the heart of Silicon Valley with the tech boom of the late 20th century. Today, it is a thriving technology hub while retaining historical landmarks that reflect its rich past.</p>
